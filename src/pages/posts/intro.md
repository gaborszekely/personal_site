Welcome to my blog! I plan to use this space to share any thoughts, tips/tricks, or interesting tidbits related to programming, tech, science, or any other topic that I'm currently interested in.

A bit of an introduction to myself - I started programing back in middle school, building simple HTML sites (see the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20070824090440/http://www.istvanpszekely.com/) for some of my work from back then ðŸ˜‚) I eventually tought myself some JavaScript, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and even a little C++ before deciding to give up and go back to doing normal teen stuff.

In college, I pursued a BS in Business Administration and eventually found myself working in sales and marketing for a few local startups. During this time, I was tasked with revamping the web presence of these companies, and rediscovered my passion for coding in the process. I decided to quit that job and enroll in a coding bootcamp so I could pursue my newfound interests professionally.

I attended Hack Reactor at Galvanize, and upon graduating found my first job as a front-end developer at Charter Communications. After a year there, I decided I wanted to level up and take a shot at the "big leagues". I spent about 2-3 months preparing for interviews, and eventually applied to Google as a Software Engineer. To my surprise, I got in!

Since then, I have been working as a SWE in the Google Cloud org on a product called [Contact Center AI](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/contact-center?hl=en), a suite of AI driven tools to enhance the quality and productivity of contact centers. I started out as a front end developer working primarily in Angular, NgRx, RxJS (with some React and Next.js before that). Since then, I have transitioned to full-stack development and have worked on various projects in Java, C++, Go, Python, and others. I am now a Senior Software Engineer and [Tech Lead Manager](https://www.teamblind.com/post/What-does-Tech-Lead-Manager-mean-in-Google-8e4VQDy1), leading a small team of engineers. I spend roughly 60% of my time coding and ~40% leading and managing my team. Working as a tech lead has been one of the most rewarding challenges of my career, and I take great joy in helping my team members level up and find their stride as an engineer.

Outside of work, I live with my girlfriend, daughter, and cat in Denver, CO. I enjoy the outdoors and especially enjoy going on hikes, climbing trips, attending concerts, and doing other fun Denverite stuff.

Welcome to my blog! I plan to use this space to share any thoughts, tips/tricks, or interesting tidbits related to programming, tech, science, or any other topic that I'm currently interested in.

A bit of an introduction to myself - I started programing way back in middle school, starting with simple HTML sites (see the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20070824090440/http://www.istvanpszekely.com/) for some of my work from back then ðŸ˜‚) I eventually tought myself some JavaScript, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and even a little C++ before deciding to give up and go back to doing normal teen stuff.

In college, I pursued a BS in Business Administration and eventually found myself working in sales and marketing for some local startups. During this time, I was tasked with revamping the web presence of these companies, and rediscovered my passion for coding in the process. I decided to quit my job and enroll in a coding bootcamp to pursue this newfound passion.

I attended Hack Reactor at Galvanize, and upon graduating found my first job as a front-end developer at Charter Communications. After a year there, I decided I wanted to level up and take a shot at the "big leagues" (FAANG). I spent about 2-3 months preparing for interviews, and eventually applied to Google as a Software Engineer. To my surprise, I got in!

Since then, I have been working as a SWE in the Google Cloud org on a product called [Contact Center AI](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/contact-center?hl=en), a suite of AI driven tools to enhance the quality and productivity of contact centers. I started out as a front end developer working primarily in Angular, NgRx, RxJS (with some React and Next.js experience before that). Since then, I have transitioned to full-stack development and have worked on various projects in Java, C++, Go, Python, and other languages. I am now a Senior Software Engineer and [Tech Lead Manager](https://www.teamblind.com/post/What-does-Tech-Lead-Manager-mean-in-Google-8e4VQDy1), leading a small team of engineers. I spend roughly 60% of my time coding and ~40% leading and managing my team. Working as a tech lead has been one of the most rewarding challenges of my career. I find great joy in helping my team members grow and develop their engineering skills.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me in Denver, CO, with my amazing girlfriend, our awesome daughter, and our feline overlord (the cat). We love exploring the outdoors â€“ hikes, climbing trips, you name it. We also catch a lot of concerts and soak up everything else Denver has to offer.

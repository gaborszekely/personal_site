Welcome to my blog! I plan to use this space to share any thoughts, tips/tricks, or interesting tidbits related to programming, tech, science, or any other topic that I'm currently interested in.

A bit of an introduction to myself - I started programing back in middle school, starting with simple HTML sites (see the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20070824090440/http://www.istvanpszekely.com/) for some of my brilliant work from back then ðŸ˜‚) I eventually tought myself some JavaScript, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and even a little C++ before going back to doing normal teen stuff.

In college, I pursued a BS in Business Administration and eventually found myself working in sales and marketing for some tech startups. During this time, I was tasked with revamping the websites of these companies, and in the process of doing that, rediscovered my passion for coding. I decided I wanted to make a change and pursue this passion full-time, so I quit my job and enrolled in a coding bootcamp.

I chose to attend Hack Reactor at Galvanize, and upon graduating, found my first job as a software developer at Charter Communications. After about a year there, I decided I wanted to level up and take a shot at the big leagues, aka the FAANG companies. I spent about 2-3 months preparing for interviews, and eventually applied to Google. To my surprise, I actually got in!

Since that time, I have been working as a software engineer in Google on a product called [Contact Center AI](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/contact-center?hl=en), a suite of AI driven tools to enhance the quality and productivity of contact centers. I started out as a frontend-focused developer working in Angular, NgRx, and RxJS. Since then, I have transitioned to full-stack development and have worked on various projects in Java, C++, Go, Python, and other languages. I am now a Senior Software Engineer and [Tech Lead Manager](https://www.teamblind.com/post/What-does-Tech-Lead-Manager-mean-in-Google-8e4VQDy1), leading a small team of engineers. I spend roughly 70% of my time as an IC and ~30% managing my team. Working as a tech lead has been one of the most rewarding challenges of my career. I find great joy in helping my team members grow and develop their engineering skills.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me in Denver, CO, with my amazing girlfriend, our awesome daughter, and our feline overlord (the cat). We love exploring the outdoors â€“ hikes, climbing trips, you name it. We also catch a lot of concerts and soak up everything else Denver has to offer.
